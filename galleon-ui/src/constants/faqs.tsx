      <span>
        The core mission that Galleon and its contributors align themselves
        around is{" "}
        <span className="text-theme-pan-sky">
          building, growing and maintaining best-in-class decentralised,
          on-chain structured products.
        </span>{" "}
        We create investment themes and strategies that appeal to retail and
        DeFi natives alike to make investing and capturing the upside of the
        crypto space as easy as one click. Major initiatives in the Galleon
        organisation that do not fit within our core mission come under the flag
        of a ‘Voyage’

    question: "What are Galleon ‘Voyages’?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        Voyages are major initiatives and extensions of the Galleon
        organisation. They are independent workstreams outside of our core
        mission of creating decentralised structured products but instead
        benefit the DAO through revenue and treasury diversification,{" "}

          direct benefits to $DBL tokenomics

        and exploration of the space to create a thriving, long-term aligned
        community.

    question: "Why we are here?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        We fundamentally believe that blockchain technology is the greatest
        innovation of our time. It is set to drastically disrupt and improve
        industries and the ways people live, work, and play. In the process,
        significant opportunities and wealth are created. Unlike with previous
        revolutions, this time, the upside is available to the broader public
        instead of just the select few. Historically, the companies shaping our
        future only went public when much of the value had already accrued. Most
        of the time, attractive investment opportunities were reserved for
        entities with the largest capital.<br></br>
        <br></br>Crypto projects turn things upside down. They issue their
        tokens in the earliest stages. Individuals can choose to invest any
        large or small sum they want.{" "}
        <span className="text-theme-pan-sky">
          We at Galleon are building innovative on-chain products that anyone in
          the World can access, regardless of wealth, race, religion, gender, or
          any other attribute. All one needs to do to optimize your long-term
          exposure to this powerful rising tide, is simply have an Ethereum
          address and a wallet.
